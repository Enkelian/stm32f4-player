# STM32F407 FLAC Player
## Overview
Created as a project for Embedded Systems course (AGH UST).

After analysing multiple repositories created for this particular platform, it became apparent that most of the existing music players support only the MP3 format. In spite of its popularity, MP3 compromises sound quality due to its lossy compression.

FLAC, as a lossless format, does not suffer from this particular drawback and allows listener to enjoy music of high quality.

This project is an attempt at creating a STM32F407 FLAC music player.

## Used hardware, software and libraries
* [STM32F407G-DISC1](https://download.kamami.pl/p561343-stm32f4disco-prod-spec.pdf) - target platform 
* [STM32Cube IDE 1.6.0](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubeide.html) - environment for development, debugging and source code generation
* [Moserial](https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Apps/Moserial?action=show&redirect=moserial#The_moserial_Project) - terminal for platform connectivity
* [libFlac](https://xiph.org/flac/) - library used to decode FLAC files
* [Audacity](https://audacity.pl/) - used to create FLAC files and analyse decoded samples

## Project development

### Creation of base project
Base code was created using STM32CubeIDE's built in CubeMX. Tests of proper mass storage configuration were conveyed using example WAVE player project.
Usage of FatFS and BSP functions would later create a foundation for our FLAC player.

### libFLAC 
After including libFLAC, it became apparent that methods of memory allocation used in the library are not compatible with our project. The `malloc` and `free` functions were relying on `sbrk`, implementation of which was auto generated by CubeMX. 

Similar errors were encountered by developers using `newlib` library. The fix proposed [here](https://nadler.com/embedded/newlibAndFreeRTOS.html) worked also in the case of `libFlac`.
